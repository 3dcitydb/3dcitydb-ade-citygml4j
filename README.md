# 3dcitydb-ade-citygml4j

> [!NOTE]
> This repository hosts the 3DCityDB v4 ADE implementation for citygml4j. Although 3DCityDB v5 is now available, 3DCityDB v4
> remains stable and operational. However, it is in **maintenance mode**, meaning no significant new features are
> planned, though existing bugs will continue to be addressed. Development is now focused on 3DCityDB v5, and we recommend
> upgrading to benefit from new features and improvements. Please refer to the [3DCityDB v5 user manual](https://3dcitydb.github.io/3dcitydb-mkdocs/)
> for more information.
